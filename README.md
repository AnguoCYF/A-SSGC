# A-SSGC: Adaptive Synergistic Similarity Graph Construction 
In industrial manufacturing, the precise identification of subtle faults is crucial, prompting a shift towards leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques. However, classical ML models often overlook the complex relationships arising from shared physicochemical properties, leading to compromised diagnostic accuracy. Addressing this gap, we propose Adaptive Synergistic Similarity Graph Construction (A-SSGC), a novel approach that merges the strengths of basic graph construction methods through an adaptive threshold strategy to capture inherent physical and chemical commonalities among samples. A-SSGC outperforms the basic methods it integrates and significantly exceeds traditional ML models across multiple industrial manufacturing datasets, achieving improvements of up to 31.3% in F1 score and 22.6% in accuracy. Visualization of the constructed graphs validates the method's ability to reveal physicochemical commonalities, enhancing interpretability and supporting deeper insights for further analysis. By effectively capturing these commonalities, A-SSGC improves diagnostic performance and underscores its potential as a versatile tool for industrial data analysis, contributing to automation and reliability in industrial processes. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/AnguoCYF/A-SSGC.

This work builds upon our previous conference paper, which introduced the initial SSGC framework for steel plate fault diagnosis. In the present study, we extend this approach by incorporating an adaptive threshold strategy and applying it across different industrial materials, leading to improved fault diagnosis performance and broader applicability.
