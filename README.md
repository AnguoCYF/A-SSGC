# A-SSGC: Adaptive Synergistic Similarity Graph Construction 
In industrial manufacturing fault diagnosis, accurately identifying subtle faults remains a critical challenge, prompting the increasing adoption of machine learning (ML) techniques.  However, classical ML models often overlook the complex relationships arising from shared physicochemical properties, leading to compromised diagnostic accuracy. Addressing this gap, we propose Adaptive Synergistic Similarity Graph Construction (A-SSGC), a novel method that adaptively fuses multiple graph construction results by leveraging node degree-based thresholds, capturing the physicochemical commonalities among samples. A-SSGC exceeds traditional machine learning models, basic graph construction methods, and both unsupervised and semi-supervised deep graph construction approaches. It consistently outperforms these baselines across representative downstream GNN models on multiple industrial manufacturing datasets. Visualization of the constructed graphs validates the method's ability to reveal physicochemical commonalities, enhancing interpretability and supporting deeper insights for further analysis. By effectively capturing these commonalities, A-SSGC improves diagnostic performance and underscores its potential as a versatile tool for industrial data analysis, contributing to automation and reliability in industrial processes.

This work builds upon our previous conference paper, which introduced the initial SSGC framework for steel plate fault diagnosis. In the present study, we extend this approach by incorporating an adaptive threshold strategy and applying it across different industrial materials, leading to improved fault diagnosis performance and broader applicability.
